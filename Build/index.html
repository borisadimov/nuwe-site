It’s our mission to transform the status of users. We think innovation must serve the greater good, and that it should pioneer systems to make our world a better place populated by happier people.

What makes people happy is creating, not just consuming. Too much consumer-based technology keeps us ‘below&#39; digital services, and it creates fragmentation and incoherence; anxiety and inefficiency.  We prefer to build technology that elevates the user above the digital services they use. We are all happier when we&#39;re making things.

To achieve this we are enabling functionally integrated, personal IoT services that use innovative technology solutions to enhance life experience. Nuwe believes that when digital solutions serve personal matters, such as health and wellness, or growth and performance, those services require a high degree of personalisation, or as it&#39;s more commonly termed, &#39;customisation&#39;. It is difficult to imagine that one type of service or application, designed by a small team, could be consumed globally. 

So we decided to create a new world in which the role of technology is to provide a multitude of components, empowering us all to build digital services.</div><div class="links"><a href="http://nuwe.co">What we’re doing to change the status quo</a><a href="developer.nuwe.co">Innovation in digital ecosystems</a></div></div></div><div class="portfolio"><div class="container"><div class="portfolio_item col-1" data-index="0"><div class="illustration"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/3rYhxPSMJymGEuKqmAKOaE/729ccd215ed10c46151491f4e5d1acaf/machine-learning-place.png" /></div><div class="label">Machine Learning</div></div><div class="details" data-index="0"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">Machine Learning</div><div class="text">Our clients frequently need to use various forms of machine intelligence.

They fail to communicate the value of wellness. So we re-imagined wellness as a universally understood unit of currency powered by actionable information, derived from connected data. 

&quot;Nuwe has created a common language which allows apps and devices to speak to each other. This means that people, teams and organisations can build a true picture of wellness. The Nuwe Value of Wellness - your Nuscore - is a personal measure that helps people understand their behaviour and make informed decisions to reach wellness goals. 

Nuscore is designed to remove the fragmentation and isolation of wellness data. It is made up of multiple data points that are collected, analysed and shared by apps built on the Nuwe platform. Nuwe creates a single ecosystem in which wellness data, Internet of Things technologies and health professionals’ discoveries combine.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div><div class="portfolio_item col-1" data-index="3"><div class="illustration"><img src="" /></div><div class="label">HealthHackers</div></div><div class="details" data-index="3"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">HealthHackers</div><div class="text">Developing great digital solutions is a complex technical challenge that demands collaboration and communication between the parties involved.

&quot;Healthhackers is an online community where members can discuss health tech challenges, and meet people with complementary skills to start making and sharing knowledge in the process of building new health apps. 

The community is a source of insight, debate and collaboration. It gives all your wellness solutions the space to grow supported by a network of developers, professionals and organisations with a common interest in unlocking the power of data and technology to help people make healthier choices.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div><div class="portfolio_item col-1" data-index="4"><div class="illustration"><img src="" /></div><div class="label">Corporate Wellness</div></div><div class="details" data-index="4"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">Corporate Wellness</div><div class="text">&quot;Many companies do not implement a meaningful wellness strategy for a simple reason: with no real measure of where the organisation should focus its resources, it can be difficult to know where to start.

&quot;Nuwe helps you control your metrics and gives a meaningful picture of your wellness programmes. It shows where you need to direct funds, and whether what you’re doing is actually delivering results. 

Hopi allows company employees to create accounts, make teams and connect their wearables of choice to privately track their daily health data. The data is turned into a Nuscore which is sent in real-time from the Nuwe platform to the Hopi Box. The Hopi Box connects this information to a large format device, like a TV, to display the company health dashboard.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div><div class="portfolio_item col-1" data-index="5"><div class="illustration"><img src="" /></div><div class="label">Security</div></div><div class="details" data-index="5"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">Security</div><div class="text">Data protection is a key concern for our clients in the Internet of Things (IoT) sector and, in particular, in the world of digital health. The landscape is evolving and the technologies required are often complex and time-consuming for newcomers, meaning companies risk delays in the release of a new service.

&quot;Nuwe is built with information security and compliance at its core. We aim to provide access to solutions that free up product development from upfront investment in time, knowledge and cost of infrastructure, policy and procedure. Our clients know that if they’re successful, they can take their product to the market with a robust solution that will work. 

We take compliance seriously because we believe it&#39;s the right thing to do. We work with third party certified firms, who carry regular external assessments against compliance standards, to ensure that our clients have the best options to protect user data.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div><div class="portfolio_item col-2" data-index="6"><div class="illustration"><img src="" /></div><div class="label">IoT Devices</div></div><div class="details" data-index="6"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">IoT Devices</div><div class="text">New IoT (Internet of Things) devices will push the boundaries of connected hardware. But although teams engineering smart devices can be as small as two or three engineers, to deploy a full service they are likely to need additional software, storage and security, as well as support to design experiences for a device that will delight users in the long term.

&quot;Nuwe makes the complexity behind recruiting and managing cloud services very simple. We aim to relax the capital requirements, and the need for different skills and more resource early on in the product development cycle. 

This gives small teams a greater chance at success by concentrating on their device engineering and the experience they want to provide for their customers, with the confidence that everything in the middle of that is taken care of by people who understand their business and have features that enable them to start work immediately.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div><div class="portfolio_item col-1" data-index="7"><div class="illustration"><img src="" /></div><div class="label">Intelligent Kitchen</div></div><div class="details" data-index="7"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">Intelligent Kitchen</div><div class="text">Our brief was to create a user experience to facilitate cooking by allowing access to recipes and step-by-step instructions, all within the kitchen workspace.

&quot;We have designed a completely new experience for sport TV channels. 

Today&#39;s IoT sensors can track body movement and match mental data to actual performance data to understand what makes us stronger and what makes us weaker. And the real fun starts when we can actively engage the audience to help them train and think like their favourite athlete, buy what they wear, eat what they eat, train like they train and ultimately, with a bit of virtual reality, compete against them or as part of their team in the sitting room.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div><div class="portfolio_item col-1" data-index="9"><div class="illustration"><img src="" /></div><div class="label">Smart Notifications</div></div><div class="details" data-index="9"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">Smart Notifications</div><div class="text">&quot;A core desire of our clients is the ability to use the data they capture intelligently, enabling their service to actively communicate with users. 

So it&#39;s natural that they&#39;ll need to implement intelligent notifications very early in your product&#39;s development, to improve the overall experience of the digital service and engage users more effectively.&quot;

&quot;Nuwe can enable notifications earlier in the roadmap with a robust set of API features for managing different types of notifications, such as native push notifications, in-app messages, emails, and text messages, that can be generated by data interpretation through machine learning and AI. 

Our system gives you an interface to create rules engines and notifications that can access data variables and events. Notifications can tap into intelligent engines, leading to insight-driven messaging for users.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div><div class="portfolio_item col-1" data-index="10"><div class="illustration"><img src="" /></div><div class="label">Liverpool Victoria</div></div><div class="details" data-index="10"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">Liverpool Victoria</div><div class="text">LV= is one of the UK&#39;s leading insurance companies.
