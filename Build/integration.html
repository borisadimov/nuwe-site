Any brand, whatever business it&#39;s in, should innovate with this in mind. Before the digital revolution, this sort of functional experience was impossible to conceive, but today technology means more and more services are provided digitally. 

We build solutions that seamlessly integrate traditional processes with technology and digital innovations to globally grow brands. The result is an ecosystem driven by consumer-centric experience.

When we move from the level of a single business model to the corporate level (i.e. multiple business models orchestrated by the same company), what matters is how all the business models are integrated together. This enables tightly integrated portfolios where multiple business models are functionally integrated.

We think the future is about building beautifully integrated and functional ecosystems designed around the consumer.&quot;</div><div class="links"><a href="developer.nuwe.co">Innovation in digital ecosystems</a><a href="http://nuwe.co">What we’re doing to change the status quo</a></div></div></div><div class="portfolio"><div class="container"><div class="portfolio_item col-2" data-index="0"><div class="illustration"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/75iha5DAqc08EwwoQSAqiy/1389f06e425d836213161ca636fd3a67/blusense.png" /></div><div class="label">Blusense Diagnostics</div></div><div class="details" data-index="0"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">Blusense Diagnostics</div><div class="text">Blusense is a young company focused on hardware innovation: they have a proprietary technology for consumerizing blood exam.

They are also active investors in corporate wellness and value the wellbeing of their employees. The company is actively exploring the use of wearables and quantified self data for improving the way they deliver corporate wellness campaigns.

&quot;Nuwe is working with LV= on a corporate wellness solution designed to promote healthy lifestyle choices amongst their employees. The project includes the creation of a leaderboard app that will be delivered via the Mendix driven intranet system. 

The app will allow LV= employees to privately track their daily health data by connecting their wearable devices to a white-label Nuwe app. The app will calculate a public NuScore for each user which can be used to track health and wellness goals.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div><div class="portfolio_item col-1" data-index="2"><div class="illustration"><img src="" /></div><div class="label">Corporate Wellness</div></div><div class="details" data-index="2"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">Corporate Wellness</div><div class="text">&quot;Many companies do not implement a meaningful wellness strategy for a simple reason: with no real measure of where the organisation should focus its resources, it can be difficult to know where to start. They often struggle to answer key questions: is our productivity increasing? Are our employees healthier? Is the return on investment acceptable?&quot;

&quot;Nuwe helps you control your metrics and gives a meaningful picture of your wellness programmes. It shows where you need to direct funds, and whether what you’re doing is actually delivering results. 

Hopi allows company employees to create accounts, make teams and connect their wearables of choice to privately track their daily health data. The data is turned into a Nuscore which is sent in real-time from the Nuwe platform to the Hopi Box. The Hopi Box connects this information to a large format device, like a TV, to display the company health dashboard.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div><div class="portfolio_item col-1" data-index="3"><div class="illustration"><img src="" /></div><div class="label">Meschino Wellness</div></div><div class="details" data-index="3"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">Meschino Wellness</div><div class="text">Meschino Wellness is an employee&#39;s wellness platform. Our brief was to rethink the interface application and user experience for the Health Risk Assessment (HRA) engine, around which the platform functions. We were asked to simplify the process and make the service more consumer friendly.

&quot;Nuwe conducted a series of focus groups to test the HRA platform and identify the areas that needed improvement. Based on the results of these tests we restructured the engine, and rewrote the questions to improve speed of comprehension and the unaided completion of the HRA. 

We also ensured the engine was dynamic, displaying relevant questions based on the answers users had provided. Nuwe then undertook a complete overhaul of the user interface. This process included improving the on-boarding messages and creating a design that both guided users as well as rewarding them for participation.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div><div class="portfolio_item col-1" data-index="4"><div class="illustration"><img src="" /></div><div class="label">Nutribu for iOS</div></div><div class="details" data-index="4"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">Nutribu for iOS</div><div class="text">Comparing calorie intake between people who are trying to lose weight involves significant difficulties.

With Nutribu installed on your smartphone, everything you eat is combined into a single number - your NuScore. Nutribu then gently and positively provides you with relevant real-time nutritional advice. Learning from your eating habits, Nutribu makes suggestions to help you achieve health and wellness goals.

They fail to communicate the value of wellness. So we re-imagined wellness as a universally understood unit of currency powered by actionable information, derived from connected data. 

&quot;Nuwe has created a common language which allows apps and devices to speak to each other. This means that people, teams and organisations can build a true picture of wellness. The Nuwe Value of Wellness - your Nuscore - is a personal measure that helps people understand their behaviour and make informed decisions to reach wellness goals. 

Nuscore is designed to remove the fragmentation and isolation of wellness data. It is made up of multiple data points that are collected, analysed and shared by apps built on the Nuwe platform. Nuwe creates a single ecosystem in which wellness data, Internet of Things technologies and health professionals’ discoveries combine.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div><div class="portfolio_item col-1" data-index="6"><div class="illustration"><img src="" /></div><div class="label">Intelligent Kitchen</div></div><div class="details" data-index="6"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">Intelligent Kitchen</div><div class="text">Our brief was to create a user experience to facilitate cooking by allowing access to recipes and step-by-step instructions, all within the kitchen workspace.

Today&#39;s IoT sensors can track body movement and match mental data to actual performance data to understand what makes us stronger and what makes us weaker. And the real fun starts when we can actively engage the audience to help them train and think like their favourite athlete, buy what they wear, eat what they eat, train like they train and ultimately, with a bit of virtual reality, compete against them or as part of their team in the sitting room.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div></div></div><div class="feed"><div class="blog"><div class="heading">Articles</div><div class="list"></div></div><div class="twitter"><div class="heading"><span>Twitter</span><a class="follow" href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=nuwehq" target="_blank">Follow @nuwehq</a></div><div class="list"></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="container"><span> © Nuwe Ltd 2015</span><span>Nuwe Ltd, 5 Fleet Place, London, EC4M 7RD</span></div></div><script src='../bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js'></script><script src='../javascript/vendor/twitterFetcher.js'></script><script src='../javascript/main.js'></script></body></html>
