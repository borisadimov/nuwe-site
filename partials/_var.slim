- @message_text = "We believe innovation serves the greater good, and should pioneer systems that make our world a better place. So we are on a mission to enable functionally integrated IoT services to use innovative mobilising, analysing and protecting solutions to engage humans with an enhanced personal experience designed to nourish human capital.\n\nNuwe believes that when digital services are designed for personal matters, such as health and wellness, or growth and performance, those services require a high degree of personalisation, or as it's more commonly termed, 'customisation'. It is difficult to imagine that one service, or application, designed by a small team could be adopted globally. For example, when we look into health, there are too many local variables and conventions in delivering services. Together with the individual's specific needs, these make it impossible to conceive a standard 'one size fits all' digital service.\n\nWe decided to imagine and implement a different way to do things. If we could distribute app components that break the barrier to build digital services and if we could locally integrate services in companies and communities, we could bring customised and personal technology to people. We believe making is better than just downloading."

- @details_text = "The Nuwe development platform enables a variety of different client applications that include communication with medical professionals as well as the engagement of end users.\n\nWe managed to accelerate the product roadmap leveraging our technology tools and thus allow for a leaner product development culture based on experimentation. Nuwe is also taking care of their experience and brand design to ensure these digital services are integrated and connected."
