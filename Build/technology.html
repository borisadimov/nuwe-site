Any brand, whatever business it&#39;s in, should innovate with this in mind. Before the digital revolution, this sort of functional experience was impossible to conceive, but today technology means more and more services are provided digitally. 

We build solutions that seamlessly integrate traditional processes with technology and digital innovations to globally grow brands. The result is an ecosystem driven by consumer-centric experience.

When we move from the level of a single business model to the corporate level (i.e. multiple business models orchestrated by the same company), what matters is how all the business models are integrated together. This enables tightly integrated portfolios where multiple business models are functionally integrated.

We think the future is about building beautifully integrated and functional ecosystems designed around the consumer.&quot;</div><div class="links"><a href="developer.nuwe.co">Innovation in digital ecosystems</a><a href="http://nuwe.co">What we’re doing to change the status quo</a></div></div></div><div class="portfolio"><div class="container"><div class="portfolio_item col-1" data-index="0"><div class="illustration"><img src="" /></div><div class="label">Open Data</div></div><div class="details" data-index="0"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">Open Data</div><div class="text">A familiar requirement for our clients is the need to integrate 3rd party IoT data sources into their own digital solutions. Our studies have shown that even using aggregators, it&#39;s still impossible to support every conceivable service. This problem only grows with self-service IoT sensors that may not have robust APIs and cloud portals with documentation to integrate with.

&quot;Nuwe creates a single ecosystem in which shared wellness data and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies combine to measure and analyse an individual&#39;s lifestyle. Through a user-centred identity, users can grant permission to app developers to share their data as they wish. 

Access to non-personal Nuwe data is also very simple with Nuwe&#39;s additional services, which enable connecting to third party APIs as easy as if they were internal data sets. Integration through Nuwe means developers can work with this data like any other, rather than building special ways to handle interaction with other APIs.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div><div class="portfolio_item col-1" data-index="1"><div class="illustration"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/3rYhxPSMJymGEuKqmAKOaE/729ccd215ed10c46151491f4e5d1acaf/machine-learning-place.png" /></div><div class="label">Machine Learning</div></div><div class="details" data-index="1"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">Machine Learning</div><div class="text">Our clients frequently need to use various forms of machine intelligence.

The landscape is evolving and the technologies required are often complex and time-consuming for newcomers, meaning companies risk delays in the release of a new service.

&quot;Nuwe is built with information security and compliance at its core. We aim to provide access to solutions that free up product development from upfront investment in time, knowledge and cost of infrastructure, policy and procedure. Our clients know that if they’re successful, they can take their product to the market with a robust solution that will work. 

We take compliance seriously because we believe it&#39;s the right thing to do. We work with third party certified firms, who carry regular external assessments against compliance standards, to ensure that our clients have the best options to protect user data.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div><div class="portfolio_item col-1" data-index="3"><div class="illustration"><img src="" /></div><div class="label">HealthHackers</div></div><div class="details" data-index="3"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">HealthHackers</div><div class="text">Developing great digital solutions is a complex technical challenge that demands collaboration and communication between the parties involved. There is an urgent need for a community that can share challenges and achievements in a productive environment that benefits all. We call this &#39;Collaborative Wellness.&#39; 

&quot;Healthhackers is an online community where members can discuss health tech challenges, and meet people with complementary skills to start making and sharing knowledge in the process of building new health apps. 

The community is a source of insight, debate and collaboration. It gives all your wellness solutions the space to grow supported by a network of developers, professionals and organisations with a common interest in unlocking the power of data and technology to help people make healthier choices.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div><div class="portfolio_item col-2" data-index="4"><div class="illustration"><img src="" /></div><div class="label">IoT Devices</div></div><div class="details" data-index="4"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">IoT Devices</div><div class="text">New IoT (Internet of Things) devices will push the boundaries of connected hardware. But although teams engineering smart devices can be as small as two or three engineers, to deploy a full service they are likely to need additional software, storage and security, as well as support to design experiences for a device that will delight users in the long term.

&quot;Nuwe makes the complexity behind recruiting and managing cloud services very simple. We aim to relax the capital requirements, and the need for different skills and more resource early on in the product development cycle. 

This gives small teams a greater chance at success by concentrating on their device engineering and the experience they want to provide for their customers, with the confidence that everything in the middle of that is taken care of by people who understand their business and have features that enable them to start work immediately.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div><div class="portfolio_item col-1" data-index="5"><div class="illustration"><img src="" /></div><div class="label">Smart Notifications</div></div><div class="details" data-index="5"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">Smart Notifications</div><div class="text">&quot;A core desire of our clients is the ability to use the data they capture intelligently, enabling their service to actively communicate with users. 

So it&#39;s natural that they&#39;ll need to implement intelligent notifications very early in your product&#39;s development, to improve the overall experience of the digital service and engage users more effectively.&quot;

&quot;Nuwe can enable notifications earlier in the roadmap with a robust set of API features for managing different types of notifications, such as native push notifications, in-app messages, emails, and text messages, that can be generated by data interpretation through machine learning and AI. 

Our system gives you an interface to create rules engines and notifications that can access data variables and events. Notifications can tap into intelligent engines, leading to insight-driven messaging for users.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div><div class="portfolio_item col-1" data-index="6"><div class="illustration"><img src="" /></div><div class="label">Easy Nutrition</div></div><div class="details" data-index="6"><div class="close"></div><div class="arrow"><img src="/images/details_arrow.png" /></div><div class="author"><div class="avatar"><img src="//images.contentful.com/yh2hio4tv3u9/5S1P5xAB4kioqkqMMGCKEU/9ec0f76b531d462e5b803aa856746ad8/NuWe_Team_Photos_Steve_Schoefield.png" /></div><div class="info"><div class="name">Steve Schofield</div><div class="author_title">CTO &amp; Co-Founder</div></div></div><div class="title">Easy Nutrition</div><div class="text">Building apps for nutrition is a complex task, requiring multiple data sets from different sources, with very little in the way of standardisation and common APIs. How can we simplify the process of enabling the creation of nutrition data and the way it can be used to track users&#39; nutrition activity?

&quot;We constructed an end-to-end API solution for nutrition apps, featuring a nutrition oriented class structure for ingredients, products, compound recipes and meals. We integrated with numerous data sources for raw ingredients with macro, micro nutrients and minerals, and simplified data sets to make them more user friendly, giving developers more options to choose for their applications. 

Nuwe also enabled full user food consumption tracking capabilities and supported this with open source UI frameworks to make prototyping and deployment a breeze.&quot;</div><div class="links"></div></div></div></div><div class="feed"><div class="blog"><div class="heading">Articles</div><div class="list"></div></div><div class="twitter"><div class="heading"><span>Twitter</span><a class="follow" href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=nuwehq" target="_blank">Follow @nuwehq</a></div><div class="list"></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="container"><span> © Nuwe Ltd 2015</span><span>Nuwe Ltd, 5 Fleet Place, London, EC4M 7RD</span></div></div><script src='../bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js'></script><script src='../javascript/vendor/twitterFetcher.js'></script><script src='../javascript/main.js'></script></body></html>
